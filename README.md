# Autoregression "Data Science Chat" Presentation

Here is a "Data Science Chat Group" presentation I did during an internship a little while back on implementing autoregressive modelling. I in know way claim I am an expert on the topic, but simply did some research and presented my findings back to my colleagues at a weekly chat group session - it was a lot of fun!
